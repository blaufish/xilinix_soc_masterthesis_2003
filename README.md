# Master Thesis Evaluating Xilinx MicroBlaze for Network SoC solutions
* Author Peter Magnusson
* Master's Thesis in Computer Engineering, Luleå University

## Abstract
This thesis aims to create a System on Chip solution for various network
 devices.  A solution with network peripherals, processor core and network software
 in a single chip is designed and evaluated.

Typical applications of a network System on Chip include Ethernet switches,
 Internet-enabled embedded systems, small Internet Protocol clients for
 handheld devices and simple Internet gateways.

The the solution utilizes the Xilinx MicroBlaze soft processor core, MicroBlaze
 Development Kit, IBM CoreConnect On-Chip Peripheral Bus (OPB) peripherals
 and Xilinx Virtex Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

## Imported from an old CVS backup using cvsfast-import

This repository is largely based on late 2003 CVS backup I found on an old disk. 
Ihould include **most** of the artifacts produced in the master thesis but did not 
fully represent the last developments. It should mostly be late changes to the
report LaTeX / LyX file that are missing.

The actual report PDF is the lastest version that was published on the university
master thesis publication index.

## Acknowledgment
The evaluation of the Xilinx MicroBlaze has been performed as a Master Thesis
 work in Computer Science and Engineering.
 The work was performed at the Department of Computer Science and Electrical
 Engineering (CSEE) and Embedded Internet Systems Laboratory (EISLAB) at
 Luleå University of Technology.

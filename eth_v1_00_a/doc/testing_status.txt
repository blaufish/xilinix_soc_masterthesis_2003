Overall:
	- Top entity seems to work well
	- RX core seems OK
	- TX core unstable (many fixes applied recently)

RTL simulations:
	- Top module simulations appear OK
	- RX core seems OK
	- TX core seems OK 
	
Real world tests:
	- RX works, tests indicates that RX remains stable after several hours of (normal) ethernet traffic.
	- TX works, first packet only. Error in VHDL-code or test software?

Overall:
	- Top entity seems to work well
	- RX core seems OK
	- TX core unstable (many fixes applied recently)

RTL simulations:
	- Only minimal tests performed, need to write a OPB-behavioral model to simplify tests.
	- Top module simulations appear OK
	- RX core seems OK
	- TX core, many recenent fixes. Possible bit order and/or CRC errors may still remain?
	
Real world tests:
	- RX works, tests indicates that RX remains stable after several hours of (normal) ethernet traffic.
	- TX fails real world tests
